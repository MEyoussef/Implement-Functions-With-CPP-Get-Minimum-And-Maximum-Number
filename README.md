/**
 * @brief Get Minimum And Maximum Number
 * @param[in] numbers - Vector of numbers
 * @return None
 *
 * This function finds the minimum and maximum number in a vector of integers.
 * At the beginning of the function, the minimum and maximum numbers are set to 0.
 *
 * Then, the function iterates through each element of the vector, and checks if the current
 * element is greater than the maximum number. If it is, the maximum number is updated to the
 * current element.
 * Similarly, the function checks if the current element is less than the minimum number.
 * If it is, the minimum number is updated to the current element.
 *
 * After the entire vector has been iterated through, the function prints the minimum and
 * maximum numbers found to the console.
